\section{Sources of the Checks in \name} \label{sec:app-source}
In Table \ref{tab:sources}, we show the detail construction process of \name by 
listing the sources of each check proposed in \name. We synthesized the insights
from the following aspects
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Our experience of developing agentic benchmarks.
    \item Best practices in existing agentic benchmarks (Table \ref{tab:all-benchmarks}).
    \item Lessons learned from issues of existing agentic benchmarks.
    \item Domain-specific suggestions when we apply well-established 
    techniques as evaluation methods.
\end{enumerate}
